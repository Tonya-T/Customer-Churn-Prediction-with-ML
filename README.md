**Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-ML**

This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn, i.e., leave a bank, versus those who remain loyal. 
The analysis will be based on the [churn.csv] Kaggle dataset, which provides relevant customer information.

this project also involves integrating a language model that can generate personalized explanations for each prediction made by the model. These explanations will provide actionable insights into why a particular customer is at risk of churning, enabling the bank to take targeted retention efforts. 

Moreover, the model will be designed to generate customized retention emails for customers who are at risk of leaving the bank, with the goal 
of reducing churn rates and improving customer satisfaction.
